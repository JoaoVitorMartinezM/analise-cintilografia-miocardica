## 1. Demographic Analysis

![Demographic Analysis](demographic_analysis.png)

### Patient Population Overview

The study population consists of **105 patients** with a near-equal gender distribution:
- **Male patients:** 51 (48.6%)
- **Female patients:** 54 (51.4%)

### Age Distribution Insights

**Age Statistics:**
- **Mean age:** 65.5 years
- **Median age:** 68.0 years  
- **Age range:** 35-89 years

The age distribution shows a predominantly elderly population, which is typical for cardiac scintigraphy procedures as cardiovascular disease risk increases with age. The slight left skew (median > mean) indicates a concentration of patients in the older age ranges.

**Clinical Implications:**
- The elderly patient population may require additional consideration for:
  - Longer procedure tolerability
  - Medication management
  - Mobility assistance
  - Extended monitoring

### Body Mass Index Analysis

**BMI Statistics:**
- **Mean BMI:** 27.9 kg/m²
- **Median BMI:** 26.9 kg/m²
- **BMI range:** 18.7-43.1 kg/m²

The population shows a tendency toward overweight status (BMI 25-29.9), with mean BMI falling in the overweight category. This is consistent with cardiovascular risk factors.

**BMI Distribution by Gender:**
- Both genders show similar BMI patterns
- Several patients fall into obese categories (BMI ≥30)
- This may impact radiotracer dosing requirements and image quality

### Age vs. BMI Correlation

The scatter plot reveals a weak positive correlation between age and BMI, suggesting that older patients tend to have slightly higher BMI values. This trend is important for:
- Dose calculations
- Procedure planning
- Risk stratification

## 2. Procedure Analysis

### Completion Rates

**Critical Finding:** Only **36.2%** of procedures were completed successfully on the first attempt.

**Completion Status Distribution:**
- **Complete:** 38 patients (36.2%)
- **Incomplete:** 67 patients (63.8%)

This low completion rate represents a significant quality improvement opportunity and suggests the need for:
- Protocol review and optimization
- Enhanced patient preparation
- Staff training initiatives
- Equipment evaluation

### Procedure Repetition Analysis

**Repetition Rate:** 38.1% of patients required procedure repetition, which is concerning from both:
- **Patient perspective:** Additional radiation exposure, time, and discomfort
- **Operational perspective:** Resource utilization and cost implications

### Repetition Reasons

**Most Common Repetition Reasons:**
1. **Hepatic Activity (Atividade Hepatica):** 10 cases
   - Indicates potential issues with radiotracer preparation or injection technique
   - May suggest need for enhanced patient preparation protocols

2. **Intestinal Loops (Alças intestinais):** Multiple cases
   - Related to gastrointestinal radiotracer uptake
   - Suggests need for improved patient fasting protocols

3. **Movement (Movimento):** Several cases
   - Patient motion artifacts affecting image quality
   - Indicates need for better patient positioning and immobilization

### Completion vs. Repetition Correlation

The cross-tabulation analysis shows that incomplete procedures have higher repetition rates, indicating that:
- Initial procedural challenges often necessitate repetition
- Quality control measures should focus on first-attempt success
- Protocol modifications could reduce both incomplete and repeated procedures

## 3. Timing and Efficiency Analysis

![Timing Analysis](timing_analysis.png)

### Procedure Duration Analysis

**Activity Time Statistics:**
- **Mean total activity time:** 145.1 minutes (2.4 hours)
- **Range:** Varies significantly based on completion status and repetitions

**Stay Time Statistics:**
- **Mean total stay time:** 210.8 minutes (3.5 hours)
- **Patient stay extends well beyond active procedure time**

### Operational Efficiency

**Efficiency Ratio:** 71.1% (Activity Time / Stay Time)

This indicates that patients spend approximately 71% of their time in active procedures, with 29% in waiting or preparation phases. This efficiency rate is relatively good but shows room for improvement.

**Efficiency Optimization Opportunities:**
- Streamline patient flow processes
- Reduce waiting times between procedure phases
- Optimize scheduling protocols
- Improve staff coordination

### Delta Time Analysis

**Rest vs. Stress Phase Timing:**
- **Rest-Stress delta correlation:** 0.085 (weak positive)
- This low correlation suggests independent timing factors for each phase
- Indicates potential for phase-specific optimization

### Time Distribution Patterns

The histograms reveal:
- **Normal distribution** for most timing metrics
- Some **outlier cases** with extremely long durations
- These outliers warrant individual case review for process improvement

## 4. Diet and Preparation Analysis

![Diet Analysis](diet_analysis.png)

### Patient Preparation Compliance

**Caffeine Consumption:** Only 15.2% of patients consumed caffeine, indicating **excellent compliance** with pre-procedure preparation instructions.

This high compliance rate suggests:
- Effective patient education protocols
- Clear preparation instructions
- Good communication between staff and patients

### Dietary Pattern Analysis

**Most Common Foods Consumed (24h before procedure):**
1. **Bread (Pães):** 58 patients (55.2%)
2. **Dairy/Cheese (Leite/Queijo):** Common
3. **Red Meat (Carne Vermelha):** Frequent
4. **Poultry (Aves):** Regular consumption
5. **Olive Oil (Azeite de Oliva):** Common

### Diet Complexity Impact

**Average diet complexity:** 3.4 food items consumed in 24 hours prior to procedure.

**Key Findings:**
- Patients with more complex diets show varying repetition rates
- Simple diets may correlate with better procedure outcomes
- This suggests potential benefits of simplified pre-procedure diet recommendations

### Preparation Recommendations

Based on the analysis:
- **Maintain current caffeine restrictions** (showing excellent compliance)
- **Consider simplified diet protocols** to reduce procedural complications
- **Focus on specific foods** that may interfere with image quality
- **Enhance patient education** about dietary impacts on procedure success

## 5. Radioactive Activity Dose Analysis

![Activity Analysis](activity_analysis.png)

### Dose Distribution Patterns

**Rest Phase Activity:**
- **Mean dose:** 16.8 mCi
- **Distribution:** Relatively narrow range with some higher doses for larger patients

**Stress Phase Activity:**  
- **Mean dose:** 21.1 mCi
- **Higher than rest phase** as expected for stress testing protocols

### Dose Correlation Analysis

**Rest vs. Stress Activity Correlation:** -0.549 (moderate negative correlation)

This unexpected negative correlation suggests:
- **Compensatory dosing:** Lower rest doses may be followed by higher stress doses
- **Protocol variation:** Different approaches based on patient characteristics or image quality
- **Clinical decision-making:** Physicians adjusting doses based on initial results

### BMI-Dose Relationships

**Rest Phase - BMI Correlation:** 0.139 (weak positive)
**Stress Phase - BMI Correlation:** 0.164 (weak positive)

These weak but positive correlations indicate:
- **Appropriate dose adjustment** for patient size
- **Room for optimization** in weight-based dosing protocols
- **Consistent with radiation safety principles**

### Clinical Implications

**Dosing Protocol Optimization:**
- Current practice shows some weight-based adjustment
- Stronger BMI-dose correlations might improve image quality
- Consider standardized weight-based dosing algorithms
- Monitor radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic quality

**Quality Considerations:**
- Dose variations may contribute to completion rate issues
- Standardized protocols could improve consistency
- Patient-specific factors should guide dosing decisions
